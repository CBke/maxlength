Maxlength jQuery plugin
=======================

This plugin makes it easy to apply a "maxlength" attribute to custom elements,
for example a `<textarea>`.
It is also gives you the possibility to add a nice character counter under the
element that shows the user how many chars he/she has left before the maxlength
is reached, and/or an alert message.

Its **simple** to use.

Requirements
------------

 * jQuery 1.2.6+
 * A modern desktop web browser *or* Internet Explorer 7+
